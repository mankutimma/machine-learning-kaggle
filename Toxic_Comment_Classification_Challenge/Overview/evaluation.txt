Submissions are evaluated on the mean column-wise log loss. In other words, the score is the average of the log loss of each predicted column.

Submission File
For each id in the test set, you must predict a probability for each of the six possible types of comment toxicity (toxic, severe_toxic, obscene, threat, insult, identity_hate). 
The columns must be in the same order as shown below. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

id,toxic,severe_toxic,obscene,threat,insult,identity_hate
6044863,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5
6102620,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5
