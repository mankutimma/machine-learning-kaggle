Data Description

The train folder contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats. Each image in this folder has the label as part of the filename. 
The test folder contains 12,500 images, named according to a numeric id. For each image in the test set, you should predict a probability that the image is a dog (1 = dog, 0 = cat).


Since, data is too large(training set is 543.52 MB and test set is 271.3MB), it has not been uploaded here on github.
