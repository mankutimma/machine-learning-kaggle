Submissions are scored on the log loss:

LogLoss=−(1/n)∑i=1 to n[ylog(Yi)+(1−y)log(1−Yi)],

where

n is the number of images in the test set
Yi is the predicted probability of the image being a dog
y is 1 if the image is a dog, 0 if cat
log() is the natural (base e) logarithm

A smaller log loss is better.

Submission File

For each image in the test set, you must submit a probability that image is a dog. The file should have a header and be in the following format:

id,label
1,0.5
2,0.5
3,0.5
